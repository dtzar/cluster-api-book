Display the list of providers and their repository configurations.

clusterctl ships with a list of known providers; if necessary, edit `$HOME/.cluster-api/clusterctl.yaml` file to add a new provider or to customize existing ones.

See [clusterctl configuration](../clusterctl-configuration) for additional info.
